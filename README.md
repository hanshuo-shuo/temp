Certainly! Below is a summary of the introduction section of the paper, including relevant concepts and formulas present in the original text.

Summary of the Introduction (Including Key Symbols)

1. Overview of Reinforcement Learning (RL)

- Reinforcement learning is a model-free paradigm that seeks to learn optimal policies through interaction with an environment. It primarily focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards over time.

1. Key Concepts

- Markov Decision Process (MDP): The foundation on which Q-learning operates is an MDP, represented by a tuple M=(S,A,P,r,γ):

- S: Set of states.

- A: Set of actions.

- P:S×A→Δ(S): Probability transition kernel, where P(s′∣s,a) indicates the probability of transitioning to state s′ given state s and action a.

- r:S×A→[0,1]: Reward function, representing the immediate rewards collected when taking action a in state s.

- γ: Discount factor, which influences the present value of future rewards, with γ∈(0,1).

1. Objective of Q-Learning

- Q-learning aims to learn the optimal action-value function Q∗(s,a) that defines the maximum expected cumulative reward when taking action a in state s and following the optimal policy thereafter. The optimal value function V∗(s) is similarly defined as:
V∗(s)=maxπ​Vπ(s)
where Vπ(s) is the expected return from state s following policy π.

1. Sample Complexity Analysis

- The paper addresses the sample complexity of Q-learning, particularly for different action spaces:

- For a single action (TD learning), the sample complexity is found to be minimax optimal, following the order:
∣S∣⋅(1−γ)3ϵ21​

- For scenarios where the action space contains at least two actions, the sample complexity is established as:
∣S∣⋅∣A∣⋅(1−γ)4ϵ21​
This highlights that Q-learning demonstrates strict suboptimality in multi-action scenarios due to overestimation issues within its framework.

1. Research Motivation

- Understanding the limitations of Q-learning’s sample efficiency draws attention to the need for improved algorithms and insights into the underlying mechanisms affecting learning performance.

This summary encapsulates the foundational elements of reinforcement learning, the specifics of Q-learning, and the key contributions of the paper regarding sample complexity. By blending these concepts with the relevant formulae, you can effectively convey the essential aspects of the introduction in your presentation.
